# Casino-Game
I made a casino game that includes: 
1. Slot machine
2. Dice 
3. Roulette Wheel
4. Black jack
5. A working leaderboard
I have a points system that allows the user to start with 50 gils.
If the user hits 0 he loses.
If the user breaks 300 he beats the casino.
Due to the requirement of the project I was not allowed to create classes to improve efficiency.
Please download the file and let me know any issues or improvements!
